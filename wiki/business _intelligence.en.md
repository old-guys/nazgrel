## Business intelligence
> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Business Intelligence (BI)** comprises the strategies and technologies used by
enterprises for the [data analysis(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)
of [business information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_information).[1]
BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of
[business operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_operations).
Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting,
online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex
event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining,
predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. BI technologies can handle large
amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop
and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for
the easy interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and
implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide businesses with
a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.[2]

Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of
business decisions - ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating
decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions
involve priorities, goals and directions at the broadest level. In all cases,
BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a
company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the
business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined,
external and internal data can provide a more complete picture which, in effect,
creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived by any singular set of data.[3]
Amongst myriad uses, business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain
insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services
for different market segments and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts.[4]

Often BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data
mart, and the concepts of BI and DW combine as "**BI/DW**"[5] or as "**BIDW**". A data
warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that facilitates decision support.

### Components

Business intelligence is made up of an increasing number of components including:

* Multidimensional aggregation and allocation
* Denormalization, tagging and standardization
* Realtime reporting with analytical alert
* A method of interfacing with unstructured data sources
* Group consolidation, budgeting and rolling forecasts
* Statistical inference and probabilistic simulation
* Key performance indicators optimization
* Version control and process management
* Open item management

### History

The earliest known use of the term "Business Intelligence" is in Richard Millar Devens’
in the ‘Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes’ from 1865. Devens used
the term to describe how the banker, Sir Henry Furnese, gained profit by receiving
and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors.
*“Throughout Holland, Flanders, France, and Germany, he maintained a complete
and perfect train of business intelligence. The news of the many battles fought
was thus received first by him, and the fall of Namur added to his profits, owing
to his early receipt of the news.”* (Devens, (1865), p. 210). The ability to
collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, an ability
that Furnese excelled in, is today still at the very heart of BI.[6]
